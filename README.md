# BLE_LED_strip
A relatively short reverse engineering of a 12V LED strip controller based on XC610 chip.

Controlling LED strip is super cool, but being forced to use an app is less cool.
Fortunatly, reversing-engineering is accessible, you just need:
- A smartphone with developer option and bluetooth debugging enabled
- A LED controller with its LED strip
- A computer, I assume you're on a linux distro but you can work it out on windows too.
- A little bit of curiosity :)
